# Building a Deployment Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy a simple "Hello, World" app in Python. GitHub Actions allows you to automate your software development workflows, including building, testing, and deploying applications. This guide provides a basic example, which you can then customize to fit your specific project needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub repository for your Python app.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Workflow

1. Inside your GitHub repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, you can create it.

2. Create a new YAML file (e.g., `deploy.yml`) for your workflow. This file will define the steps for your deployment pipeline.

3. In the `deploy.yml` file, add the following basic structure for a workflow:

   ```yaml
   name: Deployment Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main  # Change this to your main branch name

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         # Add your deployment steps here


## Step 2: Define Deployment Steps
In this step, you'll define the deployment steps specific to your "Hello, World" app. You can include tasks like installing dependencies, building the app, and deploying it. Here's an example:

   ```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v2
  with:
    python-version: 3.x  # Choose your Python version

- name: Install dependencies
  run: pip install -r requirements.txt

- name: Build the app
  run: python main.py  # Replace with your build command

- name: Deploy to Production
  run: |
    # Add your deployment script here
   ```

## Step 3: Commit and Push
Save the changes to the deploy.yml file.

Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

## Step 4: Monitor Workflow
GitHub Actions will automatically run your deployment pipeline when changes are pushed to the main branch. You can monitor the workflow's progress by navigating to the "Actions" tab in your repository.
